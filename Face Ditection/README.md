# 5 Days, 5 Python Projects Challenge

## Day 2: Face Detection Project

Welcome to the second day of the #5days5PythonProjects challenge! ðŸš€ In today's project, we delve into the fascinating realm of Face Detection using Python.

### Project Overview:

This project is part of a challenge curated by Vishwa Mohan Sir, aimed at enhancing our Python skills through hands-on projects. The focus of Day 2 is on building a robust face detection system.

### Project Highlights:

- **Implementation:** Leveraged the power of Python and the OpenCV library to develop a face detection algorithm.
  
- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Gain practical experience with image processing and computer vision.
  - Explore various face detection algorithms and their applications.
  - Strengthen understanding of computer vision concepts.

### Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhi-ratan01/5days5PythonProjects/Face%20Ditection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Day 2: Face Detection Project:**
   ```bash
   cd 5days5PythonProjects/Face%20Detection
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Project:**
   ```bash
   python FaceDetection.ipynb
   ```

### Project Structure:

- **`face_detection.py`**: Main script containing the face detection algorithm.
  
- **`images/`**: Directory for storing input images.

### Contribution:

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enhance the project.
